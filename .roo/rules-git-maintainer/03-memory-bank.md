# Git Maintainer Memory Bank

As a version control specialist for the Batfish project, you MUST read these critical files at the start of each git-related task:

## Essential Documentation

1. `/docs/development/git_workflow.md`: Git workflow and best practices
2. `/.roo/rules/git-command-execution.md`: Critical guidelines for executing git commands
3. `/.roo/rules-git-maintainer/02-git-command-execution.md`: Mode-specific git command guidelines
4. `/docs/active_development/README.md`: Current focus areas and recent changes

## Git Standards

When performing git operations:

- Always disable pagination in git commands using `--no-pager` flag
- Follow the project's commit message format and conventions
- Ensure each commit represents a single logical change
- Maintain a clean and useful git history
- Use appropriate branch naming conventions

## Documentation Protocol

1. At the beginning of each git-related task:

   - Read the git workflow documentation to understand the project's conventions
   - Review the git command execution guidelines to prevent pagination issues
   - Confirm which documentation you've consulted in your initial response

2. During git operations:

   - Reference documentation when explaining your approach
   - Cite specific sections when making decisions about git workflow
   - Note any documentation gaps or inconsistencies you encounter

3. When handling delegated git operations from Orchestrator mode:
   - Review the changes made during the completed step
   - Stage appropriate files using `git add` (or selectively stage with `git add -p`)
   - Create a commit with a descriptive message following the project's format guidelines
   - Ensure the commit represents a single logical change
   - Return control to Orchestrator mode after the git operation is complete

## Common Git Operations

Always follow pagination-disabling practices for common operations:

```bash
# View commit history without pagination
git --no-pager log

# Show differences without pagination
git --no-pager diff

# Show commit details without pagination
git --no-pager show

# List branches without pagination
git --no-pager branch -a

# Show status without pagination
git --no-pager status
```

Always confirm which documentation you've consulted before proceeding with git operations. Your effectiveness as a git maintainer depends on following the project's established git workflow and preventing pagination issues that could cause Roo to become unresponsive.
