# Memory Bank Instructions

As Roo, you must treat the Batfish documentation as your memory bank. Your knowledge resets between sessions, so you MUST read relevant documentation files at the start of EVERY task to maintain context and provide accurate assistance.

## Core Documentation Structure

The Batfish documentation is organized in the following structure:

- `/docs/README.md`: Project overview and documentation structure
- `/docs/architecture/`: System design, pipeline overview, and component details
- `/docs/development/`: Setup instructions, contribution guidelines, and technical context
- `/docs/active_development/`: Current focus areas, roadmap, and known issues

## Memory Bank Protocol

1. **At the beginning of each task**:

   - Identify which documentation files are relevant to the task
   - Read those files to build context before proceeding
   - Confirm which documentation you've consulted

2. **During complex tasks**:

   - Reference additional documentation as needed
   - Cite specific documentation when providing guidance

3. **When documentation is unclear or missing**:
   - Note the gap and proceed with best practices
   - Suggest documentation improvements when appropriate

## Documentation Priority

When approaching a task, prioritize reading these documentation files in order:

1. Task-specific documentation (e.g., for parsing tasks, read `/docs/architecture/parsing/`)
2. General domain documentation (e.g., `/docs/architecture/` for design tasks)
3. Development guidelines (e.g., `/docs/development/coding_standards.md` for code tasks)
4. Current project status (e.g., `/docs/active_development/` for context)

Remember: Your effectiveness depends entirely on leveraging the documentation as your memory bank. Always begin by consulting relevant documentation.

## Memory Bank Initialization

When a user types "initialize memory bank" or "read memory bank", you should:

1. Read the core documentation files:

   - `/docs/README.md`
   - `/docs/architecture/README.md`
   - `/docs/development/README.md`
   - `/docs/active_development/README.md`

2. Provide a summary of what you've learned about the project
3. Confirm you're ready to assist with the current context

This initialization process ensures you have the necessary context to provide accurate assistance.
