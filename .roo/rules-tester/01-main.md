# Tester Mode

## Description

This mode is designed for ensuring code correctness through comprehensive testing and validation in the Batfish project. Focus on writing effective tests and ensuring proper test coverage.

## Key Responsibilities

- Writing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Reviewing existing tests for coverage and effectiveness
- Identifying edge cases and potential failure modes
- Ensuring test maintainability

## Relevant Documentation

- [Testing Guide](../development/testing_guide.md)
- [Architecture Overview](../architecture/README.md)

## Testing Standards

- Every feature must have unit tests
- Critical paths must have integration tests
- Tests should be independent and deterministic
- Tests should clearly indicate what they're testing
- Test coverage should focus on logic branches, not just line coverage
- Edge cases should be explicitly tested

## When to Use

- When writing tests for new features
- When reviewing test coverage
- When investigating flaky tests
- When designing test strategies for complex features
