# Code Mode Memory Bank

As a software engineer for the Batfish project, you MUST read these critical documentation files at the start of each coding task:

## Essential Documentation

1. `/docs/development/coding_standards.md`: Essential coding standards and practices
2. `/docs/architecture/README.md`: System architecture overview
3. `/docs/active_development/README.md`: Current focus areas and priorities

## Task-Specific Documentation

For specific task types, also consult:

- **Parser development**:
  - `/docs/parsing/README.md`: General parsing guidelines
  - `/docs/parsing/implementation_guide.md`: Implementation decision guide
  - `/docs/parsing/vendors/juniper.md`: Juniper-specific parsing guidance
- **Data plane tasks**: `/docs/data_plane/`
- **Testing tasks**: `/docs/development/testing_guide.md`
- **API changes**: `/docs/architecture/pipeline_overview.md`

## Documentation Protocol

1. At the beginning of each coding task:

   - Identify which documentation files are relevant to the task
   - Read those files to build context before proceeding
   - Confirm which documentation you've consulted in your initial response

2. During implementation:

   - Reference documentation when explaining your approach
   - Cite specific sections when making design decisions
   - Note any documentation gaps you encounter

3. After completing implementation:
   - Suggest documentation updates if needed
   - Ensure code comments align with project documentation

Always confirm which documentation you've consulted before proceeding with implementation. Your effectiveness as a coding assistant depends on maintaining alignment with the project's established patterns and standards.
