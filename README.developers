This file contains notes for batfish developers. 

Running from an IDE
-------------------
When you run batfish, allinone, batfish_client, or coordinator using the corresponding shell script, a required Java sytem variable is automatically set. When running in an IDE (not using the shell script), you must add this system variable to your java flags.
   - Eclipse:
      1. Add every project from the 'projects' dir
      2. Go to Window->Preferences->Java->Installed JREs->Edit: set 'Default VM arguments' to (without quotes): '-DbatfishQuestionPluginDir=${workspace_loc:question}/out'
      2a. (WINDOWS ONLY) also add '-Djline.terminal=none' (without quotes) to Default VM arguments above.
      3. You may want to add questions plugin sources to enahnce your debugging experience. To do this, setup your debug configuration, and then do:
         <debug configuration>->Source->Add->Java Project->(select questions)
   - Other IDE:
      Make sure you add (without quotes, and replacing <batfish-repo-root> appropriately) '-DbatfishQuestinPluginDir=<batfish-repo-root>/projects/question/out' to your java flags when running.


Adding new information to the datamodel 
----------------------------------------

Batfish focuses on parsing information that it needs for its analysis. Its vendor-independent datamodel thus may not have all the information that the configuration files contain.  This section explains how to add new information to the datamodel using interface MTU for Cisco files as an example.

1. Enhance the Cisco parser to parse interface MTUs. The entry point for parsing Cisco files is org.batfish.grammar.cisco.CiscoParser.g4. The grammar files are in the Antlr framework.

Compile the code so that the java files that are auto-generated (by Antlr) are generated.

2. Extend the vendor-specific representation in package org.batfish.representation.cisco to include new information. The relevant file for our MTU example is Interface.java.

3. Assuming the grammar rule for parsing the MTU is mtu_if_stanza, create the following function in CiscoControlPlaneExtractor.java. 

   @Override
   public void exitMtu_if_stanza(Mtu_if_stanzaContext ctx) {
       // 1. recover the necessary information from the context
       // 2. add it to vendor representation object
       // see other functions as example
   }

4. Extend the vendor-independent datamodel in package in org.batfish.datamodel to include the new information. The relevant file for our MTU example is Interface.java.

5. Pass the new information from vendor-specific representation to vendor-independent datamodel. The starting point here is toVendorIndependentConfiguration() in org.batfish.representation.cisco.CiscoConfiguration.java.

6. Add proper Json annotations to ensure that the new information is serialized and deserialized properly. Look at what is being done for other fields.


Adding a new question
---------------------

See an existing question (e.g., UnusedStructuresQuestionPlugin) for the various classes that are needed, as well as the structure of each class and their relationships among one another.

Small but important note:  the getName() method in your subclass of Question must return a String that is all lowercase.  Otherwise the Java client will not be able to find your question when it looks for it.  Currently the Java client (see Client.java in the batfish-client project) converts a question-name argument to the "get" command to all lowercase before looking up the question.

Generating the questions wiki 
-----------------------------

The page https://github.com/batfish/batfish/wiki/Questions has documentation on the questions we currently have. 

It is automatically generated from comments in question files using the script in projects/pybatfish/org/batfish/questions_page/questions_page.py. The comment format is at the top of the script.

running 'batfish_wiki_questions' (after sourcing tools/batfish_functions.sh) will generate the markdown page. this function assumes that 
  - the batfish.wiki repository is cloned parallel to the batfish repository
  - question files are in the folder projects/questions/src

the generation script recursively scans for all files with valid comments in the folder. (it can be given multiple folders to scan.)

Generating the datamodel documentation 
--------------------------------------

Two pages that document the datamodel
   https://github.com/batfish/batfish/wiki/Datamodel
   http://batfish.github.io/batfish/docson/#../datamodel.json
Both are automatically generated

To generate them, run 'batfish_datamodel' (after sourcing tools/batfish_functions.sh). This command runs 'batfish_client -runmode gendatamodel' to get the datamodel in json. And it then runs datamodel_page.py to generate the Datamodel.md file.
