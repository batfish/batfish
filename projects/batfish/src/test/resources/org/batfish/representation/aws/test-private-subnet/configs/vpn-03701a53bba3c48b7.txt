! Amazon Web Services
! Virtual Private Cloud

! AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of 
! a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned an identifier and is 
! associated with two other identifiers, namely the 
! Customer Gateway Identifier and Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
!
! Your VPN Connection ID 		  : vpn-03701a53bba3c48b7
! Your Virtual Private Gateway ID         : vgw-0c09bd7fadac961bf
! Your Customer Gateway ID		  : cgw-07affe708bb0e5fb6
!
!
! This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be 
! configured on your Customer Gateway.
!
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! IPSec Tunnel #1
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
!
! A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption, 
! authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key parameters.
! Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
! The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
! Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).
! To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall !rules to unblock UDP port 4500. If not behind NAT, we recommend disabling NAT-T.
!
! Note that there are a global list of ISAKMP policies, each identified by 
! sequence number. This policy is defined as #200, which may conflict with
! an existing policy using the same number. If so, we recommend changing 
! the sequence number to avoid conflicts.
!

! The ISAKMP keyring stores the Pre Shared Key used to authenticate the 
! tunnel endpoints.

! #2: IPSec Configuration
! 
! The IPSec transform set defines the encryption, authentication, and IPSec
! mode parameters.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
!

! the Diffie-Hellman group and security association lifetime.

! Additional parameters of the IPSec configuration are set here. Note that 
! these parameters are global and therefore impact other IPSec 
! associations.
! This option instructs the router to clear the "Don't Fragment" 
! bit from packets that carry this bit and yet must be fragmented, enabling
! them to be fragmented.
!
crypto ipsec df-bit clear

! This option enables IPSec Dead Peer Detection, which causes periodic
! messages to be sent to ensure a Security Association remains operational.
!
crypto isakmp keepalive 10 10 on-demand

! This configures the gateway's window for accepting out of order
! IPSec packets. A larger window can be helpful if too many packets 
! are dropped due to reordering while in transit between gateways.
!
crypto ipsec security-association replay window-size 128

! This option instructs the router to fragment the unencrypted packets
! (prior to encryption).
!
! LOCAL CHANGE: commented line below
! crypto ipsec fragmentation before-encryption
  

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #3: Tunnel Interface Configuration
!  
! A tunnel interface is configured to be the logical interface associated  
! with the tunnel. All traffic routed to the tunnel interface will be 
! encrypted and transmitted to the VPC. Similarly, traffic from the VPC
! will be logically received on this interface.
!
! Association with the IPSec security association is done through the 
! "tunnel protection" command.
!
! The address of the interface is configured with the setup for your 
! Customer Gateway.  If the address changes, the Customer Gateway and VPN 
! Connection must be recreated with Amazon VPC.

! BGP is used within the tunnel to exchange prefixes between the
! Virtual Private Gateway and your Customer Gateway. The Virtual Private Gateway    
! will announce the prefix corresponding to your VPC.
!            
! Your Customer Gateway may announce a default route (0.0.0.0/0), 
! which can be done with the 'network' and 'default-originate' statements.
!
! The BGP timers are adjusted to provide more rapid detection of outages.
!
! The local BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) (65000) is configured
! as part of your Customer Gateway. If the ASN must be changed, the 
! Customer Gateway and VPN Connection will need to be recreated with AWS.
