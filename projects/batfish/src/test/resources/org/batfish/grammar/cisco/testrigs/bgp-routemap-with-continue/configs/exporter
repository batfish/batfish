! This routemap should permit our loopback /32 route.
! It intentionally has a continue statement
! Match + continue should jump to clause 30
! No match (/31 route) means no continue and we fall through to 20 and return deny
route-map TEST_EXPORT permit 10
  match ip address LIST_ALLOWED
  continue 30 
!
! If we fall through to here, block everything
route-map TEST_EXPORT deny 20

! And this is a no-op to check that ExitAccept percolates all the way up to 
! enclosing routing policy
route-map TEST_EXPORT permit 30
