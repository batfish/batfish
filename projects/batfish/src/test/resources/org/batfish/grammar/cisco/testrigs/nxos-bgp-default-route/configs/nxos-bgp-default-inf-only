! Real config from NX-OS emulator in GNS3, edited heavily to remove unrelated bits.
! All commands that matter are below, enter them after `configure terminal` / `conf t`.
!
! Relevant NX-OS command to confirm route is advertised:
!    `show ip bgp neighbors 1.2.3.0 advertised-routes`
!
! This version has default-information originate and a static route. But without a network
! statement or redistribution, default route is not advertised.
