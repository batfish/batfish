# Two interfaces in different zones, three interesting services
#
# pre-rules allow service 1
# rules deny 1 and 2
# post-rules allow 2 and 3
# default cross-zone denies
# default intra-zone accepts
#
# if compiled properly, ACL should allow 1 and 3, not 2. This proves that 1 < 2 and that 2 < 3.
#
# We will also test with (not defined) SERVICE4 = port 1004 cross/intra-zone behavior to guarantee
# rules are reached, not just default behavior.
