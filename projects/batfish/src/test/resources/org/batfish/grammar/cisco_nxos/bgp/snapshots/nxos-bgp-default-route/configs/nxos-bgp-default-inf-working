!Command: show running-config
!Time: Wed Apr 25 23:55:08 2018

! Real config from NX-OS emulator in GNS3, edited heavily to remove unrelated bits.
! All commands that matter are below, enter them after `configure terminal` / `conf t`.
!
! Relevant NX-OS command to confirm route is advertised:
!    `show ip bgp neighbors 1.2.3.0 advertised-routes`
!
! This version has default-information originate, a static route, and static route redistribution.
! Outbound route-maps are honored, so 65001 will get the route and 65002 will not.
