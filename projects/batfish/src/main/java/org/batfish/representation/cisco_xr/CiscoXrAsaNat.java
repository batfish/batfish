   * ASA NATs are only partially compatible with the ACL/routing sequence in the dataplane. Twice
   * NATs are not compatible (see below) and object NATs are partially compatible (see below and
   * warning in this function).
   *
   * First, some background. ASA NATs optionally specify a real and a mapped interface, which
   * correspond to "inside" and "outside" interfaces. NAT rules can match both source and
   * destination and transform both source and destination. Only one NAT rule applies for any given
   * packet.
   *
   * 1) ASA NATs can optionally circumvent routing for packets that match transformation. For
   *    example, if a packet would otherwise be routed to 'DMZ' but matches a rule which specifies
   *    'outside' as the mapped interface, the packet would be diverted to 'outside'. "Identity NAT"
   *    does not transform packets but can be used to impose policy routing. Identity NAT rules
   *    which specify both real and mapped interfaces can optionally require route lookups anyway,
   *    which can be useful for management traffic.
   * 2) Both inbound and outbound ACLs match against packets using the original source address and
   *    the post-NAT destination address.
   * 3) When the NAT rule des not specify a mapped interface, the routing table is used. The routing
   *    lookup uses the post-NAT destination address.
   * 4) The NAT rules match based on the original source and destination.
   * 5) When the NAT rule specifies an interface, the packet will be dropped unless there is a route
   *    to the post-NAT destination out of that interface. This implies a RIB check rather than a
   *    FIB check.
   *    "Only routes pointing out the egress interface are eligible"
   *    https://clnv.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/usa/pdf/BRKSEC-3020.pdf
   *
   * Not necessarily in chronological order, the ASA packet flow when considering twice NATs:
   * - Receive packet with original source and original destination
   * - Choose a single source and destination transformation based on original source and original
   *   destination
   * - Check inbound ACL using original source and transformed destination
   * - Route based on transformed destination or chosen transformation
   * - Drop packets which are sent by a NAT rule to an interface which does not have a route for the
   *   transformed destination.
   * - Check outbound ACL using original source and transformed destination
   * - Transmit packet with transformed source and destination
   *
   * See https://github.com/batfish/batfish/issues/3005
   *
   * P.S. Besides twice NATs, there are Object NATs. Object NATs are source-only (or
   * destination-only in reverse). If a twice NAT is chosen, Object NATS are ignored. If an object
   * NAT is chosen, it is possible to match a source NAT and a destination NAT for the same packet.
   * Object NATs do not divert packets in reverse, only forward.
