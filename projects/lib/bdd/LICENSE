You can use the note. I will try to dig up my SourceForge key at some point to update the repo/website.

Thanks, John! 

Is that documented someplace, or we just use this note from you as evidence?

Hey, John - 

We'd like to use your BDD library in an open source project (batfish.org). As our project is licensed under Apache, the LGPL license is problematic for us.

Do you make your library available under any other license (e.g., MIT or Apache)?

Thanks.
