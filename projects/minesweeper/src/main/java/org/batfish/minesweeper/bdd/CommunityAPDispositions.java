/**
 * This class represents the results of symbolic analysis of a {@link
 * org.batfish.datamodel.routing_policy.communities.SetCommunities} routing statement, as performed
 * by the {@link SetCommunitiesVisitor}.
 *
 * <p>This class can be viewed as representing a non-standard form of "three-valued" set of
 * communities, where some communities are "maybe" in the set. This generalization of community sets
 * is necessary because setting communities depends on the current communities in the route, which
 * are represented by the {@link org.batfish.datamodel.routing_policy.communities.InputCommunities}
 * expression. Hence, symbolic analysis has the effect of partitioning the atomic predicates into
 * three sets: those that are definitely set by the statement; those that are definitely removed by
 * the statement; and those that are in the route announcement after the statement if and only if
 * they were beforehand. We maintain the first two sets explicitly, while the third set is implicit
 * (everything not in the other two sets).
 *
 * <p>For example, consider representing the effects of setting (InputCommunities U 20:30), which is
 * how community addition is modeled. In this case, we know that after the statement 20:30 is
 * definitely set; nothing is definitely removed; and everything else is in the route announcement
 * if and only if it was originally.
