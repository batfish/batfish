## 2. Content Integration Approach

### 2.1. Enhanced `docs/README.md`

The main README will be enhanced to incorporate project brief and product context information:

```markdown
# Batfish Documentation

## Project Overview

Batfish is a network validation tool that provides correctness guarantees for security, reliability, and compliance by analyzing the configuration of network devices. It builds complete models of network behavior from device configurations and finds violations of network policies (built-in, user-defined, and best-practices).

### Core Mission

Batfish enables network engineers to validate configuration changes _before_ deployment, closing a critical gap in existing network automation workflows. By including Batfish in automation workflows, network engineers can ensure that only correct changes are deployed.

### Key Problems Solved

- **Configuration Complexity**: Modern networks involve numerous devices with complex, interdependent configurations
- **High Cost of Errors**: Misconfigurations can lead to outages, security breaches, and compliance violations
- **Limited Testing**: Traditional network testing methods are manual, time-consuming, and often incomplete
- **Vendor Diversity**: Networks typically include devices from multiple vendors with different configuration languages

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into several sections:

- **[Active Development](active_development/README.md)**: Current focus areas, roadmap, and known issues
- **[Architecture](architecture/README.md)**: System design, pipeline overview, and component details
- **[Development](development/README.md)**: Setup instructions, contribution guidelines, and technical context
- **[User Guide](user_guide/README.md)**: Usage instructions, use cases, and best practices

## For Developers

```markdown
# Batfish Architecture

This document provides an overview of Batfish's architecture and key design decisions.

## Core Architecture

Batfish follows a pipeline architecture with distinct stages:

1. **[Parsing](parsing/README.md)**: Convert vendor-specific configurations into parse trees
2. **[Extraction](extraction/README.md)**: Extract data from parse trees into vendor-specific models
3. **[Conversion](conversion/README.md)**: Convert vendor-specific models into vendor-independent models
4. **[Post-processing](post_processing/README.md)**: Finalize and clean up the vendor-independent model
5. **[Data Plane Generation](data_plane/README.md)**: Compute routing information bases and forwarding tables
6. **[Forwarding Analysis](forwarding_analysis/README.md)**: Analyze forwarding behavior

## Key Design Decisions

### Vendor-Independent Model

Batfish converts all vendor-specific configurations into a unified vendor-independent model. This allows analysis algorithms to work consistently across different network devices.

**Rationale**: This approach enables Batfish to support multiple vendors without duplicating analysis code.

### Parse Tree-Based Extraction

Batfish uses ANTLR-generated parsers to create parse trees, which are then processed to extract configuration data.

**Rationale**: This approach provides a clean separation between syntax recognition and semantic interpretation.

### Symbolic Analysis

Batfish uses symbolic analysis techniques to efficiently reason about large sets of packets.

**Rationale**: This approach allows Batfish to analyze network behavior for all possible packets without having to enumerate them individually.

## Component Interactions

### Question Framework

Questions are the primary way users interact with Batfish. Each question is implemented as a plugin that can access the network model and data plane.

### Data Model Evolution

The data model evolves through these stages:

1. Vendor-specific text configurations
2. Parse trees
3. Vendor-specific Java objects
4. Vendor-independent Java objects
5. Data plane structures

## Extension Points

Batfish is designed to be extensible in several ways:

1. **Adding New Device Support**:

   - Implement a parser for the device's configuration language
   - Create extraction logic to populate vendor-specific models
   - Implement conversion logic to the vendor-independent model

2. **Adding New Analysis Capabilities**:

   - Implement new questions that use the existing data model
   - Extend the data model to capture new types of information
   - Add new analysis algorithms that operate on the data plane

3. **Integrating with External Systems**:
   - Use the RESTful API provided by the coordinator
   - Use the Python SDK (Pybatfish) to script interactions

## Pipeline Details

For detailed information on each pipeline stage, see the corresponding documentation:

- [Pipeline Overview](pipeline_overview.md)
- [Parsing](parsing/README.md)
- [Extraction](extraction/README.md)
- [Conversion](conversion/README.md)
- [Post-processing](post_processing/README.md)

### 5.2. `development/testing_guide.md`

````markdown
# Batfish Testing Guide

This document provides guidelines for testing Batfish code. Comprehensive testing is essential to ensure the correctness and reliability of Batfish's analysis.

## Testing Philosophy

Batfish follows a multi-layered testing approach:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **Reference Tests**: Compare output against known-good reference files
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows using Pybatfish

## Unit Testing

### When to Write Unit Tests

- For all new classes and methods
- When fixing bugs
- When refactoring existing code

### Unit Test Best Practices

- Test one thing per test method
- Use descriptive test method names
- Set up test fixtures efficiently
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Keep tests independent and deterministic

### Example Unit Test

```java
@Test
public void testIpAddressContainedIn() {
  Ip ip = Ip.parse("192.0.2.1");
  Prefix prefix = Prefix.parse("192.0.2.0/24");
  assertTrue(prefix.containsIp(ip));

  Prefix otherPrefix = Prefix.parse("198.51.100.0/24");
  assertFalse(otherPrefix.containsIp(ip));
}
```
````

## Integration Testing

### When to Write Integration Tests

- For interactions between components
- For end-to-end functionality
- For complex workflows

### Integration Test Best Practices

- Use realistic test data
- Test complete workflows
- Verify all side effects
- Clean up test resources

## Reference Testing

Batfish uses reference tests to compare the output of parsing, conversion, and analysis against known-good reference files.

### How Reference Tests Work

1. Parse and process a test configuration
2. Serialize the resulting data structures
3. Compare with stored reference files
4. Update reference files when behavior intentionally changes

### Reference Test Best Practices

- Include diverse test configurations
- Review reference file changes carefully
- Document why reference files changed

## End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests use Pybatfish to test complete workflows from a user's perspective.

### End-to-End Test Best Practices

- Test common user workflows
- Verify correct output for questions
- Test with realistic network configurations

## Test Coverage

Batfish aims for high test coverage, but focuses on logical coverage rather than just line coverage.

### Coverage Goals

- 90% line coverage for core components
- 100% coverage for critical paths
- Test all error conditions and edge cases

### Measuring Coverage

- Use Jacoco for Java code coverage
- Review coverage reports regularly
- Address coverage gaps in critical areas

## Testing Tools

### JUnit

Batfish uses JUnit 5 for Java tests.

### Hamcrest Matchers

Use Hamcrest matchers for readable assertions.

### Mockito

Use Mockito for mocking dependencies in unit tests.

## Continuous Integration

All tests run automatically on pull requests through GitHub Actions.

### CI Best Practices

- Fix failing tests promptly
- Don't disable tests without good reason
- Investigate flaky tests

````

### 5.3. `development/git_workflow.md`

```markdown
# Batfish Git Workflow Guide

This document outlines the git workflow and best practices for the Batfish project.

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Structure

Each commit should:
- Represent a single logical change
- Be complete and self-contained
- Not break the build or tests
- Include relevant tests and documentation

### Commit Messages

Commit messages should follow this format:

````

<type>: <short summary>

<detailed description>

<references>
```

Where:

- **Type**: One of the following:
  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - `test`: Adding or modifying tests
  - `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
- **Short summary**: A concise description (50 chars or less)
- **Detailed description**: More detailed explanation when necessary
- **References**: GitHub issue references (e.g., "Fixes #123")

Example:

```
feat: add support for Arista EOS BGP configuration

This change adds parsing, extraction, and conversion support for
BGP configuration in Arista EOS devices. It includes:
- Grammar rules for BGP configuration blocks
- Extraction to vendor-specific model
- Conversion to vendor-independent model

Fixes #456
```

## Branch Management

### Branch Naming

Branch names should follow this format:

```
<type>/<description>
```

Where:

- **Type**: Same as commit types (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- **Description**: Brief description using hyphens as separators

Example: `feat/arista-eos-bgp-support`

### Branch Workflow

1. Create a branch for each feature or fix
2. Make regular commits as you progress
3. Keep branches up to date with the main branch
4. Submit a pull request when ready for review

## When to Commit

Create commits at these checkpoints:

1. After setting up the initial structure for a task
2. After implementing core functionality
3. After adding tests
4. After addressing review feedback

## Using Git for Recovery

### When to Roll Back

Consider rolling back when:

- A development approach proves to be incorrect
- Changes introduce unexpected complications
- You want to try an alternative implementation

### How to Roll Back

#### For uncommitted changes:

```bash
# Discard all uncommitted changes
git restore .

# Discard changes to specific files
git restore <file1> <file2>
```

#### For committed changes:

```bash
# Soft reset (keep changes in working directory)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Hard reset (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Revert a commit (create a new commit that undoes changes)
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### Creating Checkpoints

To create a checkpoint you might want to return to:

```bash
# Create a checkpoint commit
git commit -m "checkpoint: implemented feature X approach 1"

# Create a branch at this point for easy reference
git branch checkpoint/feature-x-approach-1
```

## Advanced Git Techniques

### Interactive Rebase

Use interactive rebase to clean up commits before submitting a pull request:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~<number-of-commits>
```

### Cherry-picking

Apply specific commits from one branch to another:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### Stashing

Temporarily store changes when you need to switch contexts:

```bash
# Stash changes
git stash save "description of changes"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply a stash
git stash apply stash@{0}
```

## Git Hooks

Batfish uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. These hooks:

- Format code according to project standards
- Run linters to catch common issues
- Verify that tests pass

See [.pre-commit-config.yaml](/.pre-commit-config.yaml) for details.

````

## 6. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Documentation Restructuring
1. Create the new integrated directory structure
2. Move and enhance existing documentation
3. Create new documentation for standards and guidelines
4. Add git workflow documentation

### Phase 2: Mode Configuration
1. Create the `.roo` directory with mode configurations
2. Write mode-specific documentation
3. Configure context files for each mode

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement
1. Test each mode with typical tasks
2. Gather feedback from team members
3. Refine mode configurations and documentation

## 7. Conclusion

This comprehensive plan:
1. Integrates memory bank concepts directly into the existing documentation structure
2. Creates project-local Roo modes customized for Batfish development
3. Adds specialized modes for testing, code review, and git operations
4. Documents all standards and best practices
5. Ensures each mode has access to the most relevant context

The result will be a cohesive system that provides contextual awareness throughout the documentation and tailors the Roo experience to specific development tasks within the Batfish project.

- Certain services (e.g., DNS) are globally reachable

### Security

- Sensitive services can be reached only from specific subnets or devices
- Paths between endpoints are as expected (e.g., traverse a firewall, have at least 2 way ECMP, etc...)

### Change Analysis

- End-to-end reachability is identical across the current and a planned configuration
- Planned ACL or firewall changes are provably correct and causes no collateral damage for other traffic
- Two configurations, potentially from different vendors, are functionally equivalent
