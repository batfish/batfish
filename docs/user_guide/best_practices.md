# Batfish Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for using Batfish effectively in your network analysis workflows.

## Snapshot Management

### Organizing Snapshots

- **Use Consistent Naming Conventions**: Name snapshots in a way that clearly indicates their purpose and timestamp (e.g., `prod-network-2025-05-01`, `change-123-before`, `change-123-after`).

- **Include Metadata**: Store metadata with your snapshots, such as:

  - Purpose of the snapshot
  - Date and time created
  - Network version or change ticket number
  - Creator information
  - Related snapshots (e.g., before/after pairs)

- **Maintain a Snapshot Library**: Keep important snapshots for historical reference, including:

  - Baseline snapshots of stable network states
  - Pre/post snapshots of significant changes
  - Snapshots related to incidents or issues

- **Automate Snapshot Creation**: Integrate snapshot creation into your workflows:
  - Create snapshots as part of change management processes
  - Schedule regular snapshots of production networks
  - Generate snapshots before and after maintenance windows

### Snapshot Content

- **Include All Relevant Files**:

  - Device configurations
  - Routing table dumps (if available)
  - BGP tables (if available)
  - Host configurations (if relevant)

- **Ensure Configuration Consistency**: Make sure all configurations in a snapshot represent a consistent state of the network.

- **Validate Snapshot Parsing**: Check that Batfish can parse all files in your snapshot without errors.

## Question Selection and Usage

### General Approach

- **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with broad questions that give an overview, then drill down into specific areas of interest.

- **Combine Multiple Questions**: Use the results of one question to inform parameters for subsequent questions.

- **Create Reusable Workflows**: Develop standard sets of questions for common tasks like compliance checking or change validation.

- **Parameterize Questions**: Use variables and parameters to make questions more flexible and reusable.

### Differential Analysis

- **Use Consistent Baselines**: When comparing snapshots, ensure the baseline snapshot is consistent across analyses.

- **Focus on Relevant Differences**: Filter differential results to focus on meaningful changes rather than expected differences.

- **Validate Both Directions**: Check both what has been added and what has been removed by a change.

- **Document Intentional Differences**: Keep track of which differences are expected and which are unexpected.

## Integration with Network Workflows

### Change Management

- **Pre-Change Validation**:

  1. Create a snapshot of the current network
  2. Create a snapshot with proposed changes
  3. Run differential analysis to identify potential issues
  4. Verify that changes achieve their intended purpose

- **Post-Change Validation**:
  1. Create a snapshot after changes are implemented
  2. Compare with pre-change snapshot to verify expected differences
  3. Compare with proposed-change snapshot to verify implementation matches plan

### Continuous Compliance

- **Define Compliance Policies**: Translate organizational policies into Batfish questions.

- **Schedule Regular Checks**: Run compliance checks on a regular schedule.

- **Track Compliance Over Time**: Monitor compliance trends to identify recurring issues.

- **Integrate with Alerting**: Generate alerts for new compliance violations.

### Troubleshooting

- **Snapshot the Current State**: Create a snapshot of the network as soon as an issue is identified.

- **Isolate the Problem**: Use targeted questions to narrow down the source of the issue.

- **Compare with Known-Good State**: Use differential analysis to compare with a snapshot from when the network was working correctly.

- **Document Findings**: Record the analysis process and findings for future reference.

## Performance Optimization

### Managing Large Networks

- **Use Node Filters**: Limit analysis to relevant portions of the network when working with large networks.

- **Start with Representative Subsets**: For initial analysis, focus on a representative subset of the network before expanding to the full network.

- **Optimize Question Parameters**: Use constraints in questions to limit the scope of analysis.

- **Consider Snapshot Segmentation**: For very large networks, consider creating separate snapshots for different network segments.

### Resource Management

- **Monitor Memory Usage**: Be aware of memory consumption, especially with large networks.

- **Close Unused Sessions**: Close Batfish sessions when they're no longer needed.

- **Batch Complex Analyses**: For resource-intensive analyses, batch questions and run them during off-hours.

## Data Visualization and Reporting

### Effective Visualization

- **Choose Appropriate Visualizations**: Select visualization types that best represent the data:

  - Network diagrams for topology information
  - Heat maps for identifying patterns
  - Tables for detailed information
  - Graphs for trends over time

- **Highlight Important Information**: Use color coding, filtering, and sorting to emphasize key findings.

- **Provide Context**: Include relevant context with visualizations to aid interpretation.

### Reporting

- **Create Standardized Reports**: Develop templates for common reports like compliance checks or change validations.

- **Include Executive Summaries**: Provide high-level summaries for non-technical stakeholders.

- **Maintain Report History**: Keep historical reports to track changes over time.

- **Automate Report Generation**: Integrate report generation into regular workflows.

## Extending Batfish

### Custom Questions

- **Develop Reusable Custom Questions**: Create custom questions for organization-specific analyses.

- **Share Questions Within Teams**: Establish a library of useful questions for your organization.

- **Version Control Questions**: Maintain question definitions in version control.

### Integration with Other Tools

- **Integrate with Configuration Management**: Connect Batfish with your configuration management system.

- **Combine with Monitoring Data**: Correlate Batfish analysis with data from monitoring systems.

- **Integrate with CI/CD Pipelines**: Include Batfish validation in automated deployment pipelines.

## Team Collaboration

### Knowledge Sharing

- **Document Common Workflows**: Create documentation for standard analysis procedures.

- **Conduct Training Sessions**: Train team members on effective use of Batfish.

- **Share Success Stories**: Highlight cases where Batfish helped prevent issues or solve problems.

### Collaborative Analysis

- **Use Shared Notebooks**: Develop and share Jupyter notebooks for common analyses.

- **Establish Review Processes**: Have team members review each other's analyses for quality and completeness.

- **Maintain a Knowledge Base**: Document findings, patterns, and solutions for future reference.

## Continuous Improvement

### Refining Analyses

- **Review and Update Questions**: Regularly review and improve your question library.

- **Learn from Missed Issues**: When problems occur, analyze why they weren't caught and update your validation processes.

- **Incorporate Feedback**: Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to improve analyses and reports.

### Keeping Current

- **Stay Updated with Batfish**: Keep up with new Batfish features and capabilities.

- **Adapt to Network Evolution**: Update analyses as your network architecture evolves.

- **Share Best Practices**: Contribute to the Batfish community by sharing your best practices and custom questions.
