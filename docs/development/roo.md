# Roo

[Roo](https://roocode.com) is an AI coding assistant integrated with this project to help with development tasks. This document provides a brief overview of how Roo is configured and used in the Batfish project.

## What is Roo?

Roo is an AI coding assistant that helps with various development tasks including:

- Writing and modifying code
- Debugging issues
- Designing systems and architecture
- Answering questions about the codebase
- Creating and maintaining documentation
- Testing and reviewing code
- Managing git operations

## Roo Modes

Roo operates in different "modes" that specialize its behavior for specific tasks. Each mode has different capabilities, expertise, and file access permissions. The Batfish project has configured several custom modes:

- **üíª Code**: Implements features and fixes bugs
- **üèóÔ∏è Architect**: Designs systems and creates implementation plans
- **‚ùì Ask**: Answers questions about the codebase without making changes
- **ü™≤ Debug**: Diagnoses and resolves issues
- **ü™É Orchestrator**: Coordinates complex tasks across multiple domains
- **üß™ Tester**: Creates and maintains tests
- **üëÄ Reviewer**: Reviews code for quality and adherence to standards
- **üîÑ Git Maintainer**: Manages git operations and maintains clean history
- **üìù Documentation Writer**: Creates and updates documentation

## Mode Configuration

The detailed configuration for each mode is maintained in the `.roo/rules-*` directories at the root of the project. For example:

- Code mode: `.roo/rules-code/`
- Git Maintainer mode: `.roo/rules-git-maintainer/`

These directories contain the configuration that Roo uses to understand how to behave in each mode, including responsibilities, file access restrictions, and mode-specific guidelines.

## Memory Bank Approach

Roo uses a "memory bank" approach to maintain context across sessions. Since Roo's memory resets between sessions, it relies on the project documentation as its persistent knowledge base. At the beginning of each task, Roo will:

1. Identify which documentation files are relevant to the task
2. Read those files to build context before proceeding
3. Confirm which documentation it has consulted

This approach ensures that Roo always has access to the most up-to-date project information and can provide consistent assistance across sessions.

### Documentation Structure

The key documentation files that serve as Roo's memory bank include:

- `/docs/README.md`: Project overview and documentation structure
- `/docs/architecture/`: System design and component details
- `/docs/development/`: Setup instructions and contribution guidelines
- `/docs/active_development/`: Current focus areas and known issues

Keeping these documentation files accurate and comprehensive helps Roo provide better assistance.

### Memory Bank Initialization

You can explicitly initialize Roo's memory bank by typing "initialize memory bank" or "read memory bank" in the chat. This will prompt Roo to read the core documentation files and build context before assisting with your task.

## Using Roo

To use Roo with this project:

1. Install the [Roo extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.roo)
2. Open the Batfish project in VS Code
3. Access Roo through the sidebar or by using keyboard shortcuts

To switch between modes:

1. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Type "Roo: Switch Mode" and select it
3. Choose one of the available modes

Alternatively, use the mode selector in the Roo sidebar or type a slash command like `/code` or `/debug` in the Roo chat.
