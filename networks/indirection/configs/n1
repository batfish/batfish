### bgp import policy is as follows:
### 1. run candidate advertisement through ps-from-2-tagger, applying transformations along the way
### - if it is accepted, stop and accept
### - if it is rejected stop and reject
### - if a next policy action is applied, or if neither accept nor reject is applied by the end of ps-from-2-tagger, then move on to the next policy [conjunction]
set protocols bgp group physical neighbor 10.0.12.2 import ps-from-2-tagger
### 2. if we get this far, run the advertisement through ps-from-2-criterion-1
### - if it is accepted, move on to ps-from-2-criterion-2
### - if it is rejected, stop and reject
### - if a next policy action is applied, or if neither accept nor reject is applied by the end of ps-from-2-criterion-1, then ALSO move on to ps-from-2-criterion-2
### 3. if we get to ps-from-2-criterion-2, then
### - if it is accepted, stop and accept
### - if it is rejected, stop and reject
### - if neither, then do default-action
### - if default-action not specified, then do default-action for bgp import policy (accept) 
set protocols bgp group physical neighbor 10.0.12.2 import (ps-from-2-criterion-1 && ps-from-2-criterion-2)

### advertisement match this term if ps-from-2-sub-1 matches the advertisement. any transformations done in ps-from-2-sub-1 are applied immediately
set policy-options policy-statement ps-from-2-tagger term 1 from policy ps-from-2-sub-1
### move onto next policy if matched. which policy depends on where this was called from
set policy-options policy-statement ps-from-2-tagger term 1 then next policy
### reject if not matched by previous term. no further processing
set policy-options policy-statement ps-from-2-tagger term 2 then reject

### match this term for advertisements with prefix matching first 8 bits of 1.0.0.0 with declared length of 8-32
set policy-options policy-statement ps-from-2-sub-1 term 1 from route-filter 1.0.0.0/8 orlonger
### if matched, set metric to 500, set local-preference to 55, and accept. since this accept is part of a subprocedure, it just means the calling term will match, rather than that the advertisement is accepted
set policy-options policy-statement ps-from-2-sub-1 term 1 then metric 500
set policy-options policy-statement ps-from-2-sub-1 term 1 then local-preference 55
set policy-options policy-statement ps-from-2-sub-1 term 1 then accept
### if above term does not match, then reject. since this reject is part of a subprocedure, it just means the calling term will not match, rather than that the advertisement is rejected.
set policy-options policy-statement ps-from-2-sub-1 term 3 then reject

### if metric so far is 500, then set it to 1000
set policy-options policy-statement ps-from-2-criterion-1 term 1 from metric 500
set policy-options policy-statement ps-from-2-criterion-1 term 1 then metric 1000
### accept. since this accept is part of a conjunction, it just means we can move onto the next policy, rather than that the advertisement is accepted
set policy-options policy-statement ps-from-2-criterion-1 term 2 then accept

### if local-preference so far is 55, then add the community '2:1' and move onto the next term
set policy-options policy-statement ps-from-2-criterion-2 term 1 from local-preference 55
set policy-options policy-statement ps-from-2-criterion-2 term 1 then community add from-2-comm
set policy-options policy-statement ps-from-2-criterion-2 term 1 then next term
### accept. since this is the last conjunct, this indeed indicates the advertisement is accepted
set policy-options policy-statement ps-from-2-criterion-2 term 2 then accept

set policy-options community from-2-comm members 2:1
