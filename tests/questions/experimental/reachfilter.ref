The behaviors can be: that the filter permits the header (permit), that it denies the header (deny), or that the header is matched by a particular line (matchLine <lineNumber>). Filters are selected using node and filter specifiers, which might match multiple filters. In this case, a (possibly different) header will be found for each filter.",
