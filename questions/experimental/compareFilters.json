        "longDescription": "This question can be used to summarize how a filter has changed over time. In particular, it highlights differences that cause flows to be denied when they used to be permitted, or vice versa. The output is a table that includes pairs of lines, one from each version of the filter, that both match at least one common flow, and have different action (permit or deny). This is a differential question and the reference snapshot to compare against must be provided in the call to answer().",
