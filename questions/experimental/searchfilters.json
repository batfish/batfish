The behaviors can be: that the filter permits the flow (permit), that it denies the flow (deny), or that the flow is matched by a particular line (matchLine <lineNumber>). Filters are selected using node and filter specifiers, which might match multiple filters. In this case, a (possibly different) flow will be found for each filter",
