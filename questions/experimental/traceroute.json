    "longDescription": "This question performs a virtual traceroute in the network from a starting node. A destination IP and ingress (source) node must be specified. Other IP headers are given default values if unspecified.\nUnlike a real traceroute, this traceroute is directional. That is, for it to succeed, the reverse connectivity is not needed. This feature can help debug connectivity issues by decoupling the two directions.",
